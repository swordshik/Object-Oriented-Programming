if elements in the list can make arithmetic progression, then for each element we can find other element, such that difference of them is equal to some B. if we sort this list, difference of each pair in order, needs to be equal to that B. My code is just compares difference of each pair with difference of the first pair, and if they are all equal, returns True, otherwise - False.
