# Fifth Assignment: Object-Oriented Programming

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming concepts in Python. It includes classes for managing various types of devices (laptops, tablets, smartphones), a shopping cart, and a shop. The project allows users to add devices to a cart, remove devices, display cart information, calculate total price, apply discounts, and checkout.

## Classes

### Device Class

The `Device` class is a base class for all devices with the following attributes and methods

### Laptop Class

The `Laptop` class inherits from the `Device` class and represents a laptop with additional attributes and methods

### Tablet Class

The `Tablet` class inherits from the `Device` class and represents a tablet with additional attributes and methods

### Smartphone Class

The `Smartphone` class inherits from the `Device` class and represents a smartphone with additional attributes and methods


### Cart Class

The `Cart` class manages a shopping cart


### Shop Class

The `Shop` class manages a collection of devices


## Running the Code

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repository or download the project files.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the `main.py` file to start the shopping application
