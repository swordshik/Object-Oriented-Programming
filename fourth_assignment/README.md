# What is it?

This is project of user service for my OOP course in university

# How it works?

user file creates objects via asking user of his name and surname and birthday. Each user object has unique id number and password ( containing at least 1 small, 1 upper, 1 special characters as well as 1 number), which are given to the user right after creating an object.
Each object then stored in users dictionary, with the key being id number of the object, so users is kind of an classroom, where students are user objects.

# How to run the program
Copy the repository to your IDE, go to the fourth assignment file, and run the main file, or download the fourth assignment file directly, and run the main file in your IDE
